# 1) A was successful. For b, there was an error message because the root was too close to the end point. C was successful. It is not possible for bisection for find the root x=0.Â 

# 2a) The code was successful and the approximate root for A is 1. The desired accuracy was achieved. 
# 2b) The code was not successful. An error occured because the root was close to the end point. Error was extremely large.
